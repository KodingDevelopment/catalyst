A framework to streamline development of plugins for clients.

## Why?

Copy and pasting code sucks. Between numerous clients, I've found myself writing the same code over and over again. This
framework aims to streamline the development of plugins for clients by providing a set of classes and methods that can
be used to quickly develop plugins.

Much of this framework is inspired by Nucleus, which is created by the [HubbleMC](https://github.com/HubbleMC) team.
It's a framework I helped design, however it's not open source as it has some *very* proprietary code in it. This
framework is a re-implementation of the core features of Nucleus, but with a few changes to make it more flexible and
open source.
